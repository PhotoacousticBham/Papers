# Angular Airy function

The scripts presented in this paper were used to compute the results from the paper:

[Dylan M. Marques, James A. Guggenheim, and Peter R. T. Munro, "Angular Airy function: a model of Fabry-Perot etalons illuminated by arbitrary beams," Opt. Express 29, 24144-24150 (2021)](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-15-24144&id=453309###)

If you publish scientific results based on this scripts, please consider citing the paper.

The results are based on an optical model of Fabry-PÃ©rot (FP) etalons illuminated with a focused beam. All scripts have been implemented in [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

The 4 scripts available do:
* angularAiryFunction.jl - implementation of the equations shown in the paper;
* modelCompairisonExperimental.jl - compute the data shown in fig. 2;
* intuitiveUnderstanding.jl - compute the data shown in fig. 3;
* modelCompairison.jl - show that the angular Airy function matches a multilayer model (data not shown in the paper);

To compute the results, we used the version 0.1.4 of [Jolab.jl](https://github.com/DylanMMarques/Jolab.jl) which (indirectly) implements the angular Airy function. The same results can be computed based on the scripts available in angularAiryFunction.jl
